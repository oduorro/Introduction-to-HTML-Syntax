    </header>
    <p>Hi, my name is Nicholas Oduor and I'm learning HTML...</p>
    <h2>My Motivation</h2>
    <p>I'm motivated to learn HTML because I want to be able to create my own websites and have more control over their design and functionality. I also believe that having a basic understanding of HTML will be useful in many other areas of my life, such as email marketing and blogging.</p>
